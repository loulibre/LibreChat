# LibreChat Project Changes Summary

## Overview
This commit implements a staged approach to enhance LibreChat with RAG API documentation and experimental custom endpoints integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. RAG API Documentation and Implementation
- Added comprehensive documentation for the RAG API in `rag_api/README.md`
- Included detailed information about API endpoints, integration steps, setup instructions, and troubleshooting tips
- Added complete RAG API implementation files including:
  - Docker configuration files
  - Python implementation files
  - Example files for testing
  - Utility scripts

### 2. Custom Endpoints Implementation (Moved to Separate Branch)
- Created a custom endpoints system in `api/server/services/Endpoints/custom/`
- Implemented an Ollama integration that provides a proxy between LibreChat and Ollama
- Added documentation, configuration examples, and test scripts
- Clearly marked as experimental with appropriate notices
- Moved to `custom_endpoints_dev` branch for continued development

## Development Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Contains stable RAG API implementation ready for production use
- **Custom Endpoints Dev Branch**: Contains experimental features for future development

## Next Steps
1. Continue development of the Ollama integration in the `custom_endpoints_dev` branch
2. Consider creating a code-specific RAG service optimized for code repositories
3. Improve documentation and testing for both features

This approach allows us to maintain a stable main branch while preserving our work on experimental features for future development.
