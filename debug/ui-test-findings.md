# LibreChat UI Testing Findings

## Summary of Issues

Based on our testing and analysis of the HAR file, we've identified the following issues:

1. **Authentication Problem**: The browser is making requests to the LibreChat API without proper authentication, resulting in 401 Unauthorized responses.

2. **Account Issue**: When attempting to authenticate, we received a message indicating that the account has been temporarily banned.

3. **Ollama API Working**: Both direct access to the Ollama API and access through our proxy are working correctly, confirming that the Ollama service itself is functioning properly.

## Detailed Analysis

### Browser Requests (from HAR file)

The browser is making POST requests to `http://localhost:3080/api/ask/custom` with the following characteristics:
- No Authorization header is present
- The request includes the correct endpoint ("ollama") and model ("llama2")
- The server responds with 401 Unauthorized

### Authentication Test

When attempting to authenticate using our test script, we received:
```
{"message":"Your account has been temporarily banned due to violations of our service."}
```

This suggests an issue with the account being used, not with the API configuration.

### Ollama API Tests

Both direct access to the Ollama API and access through our proxy are working correctly:
- Direct request to `http://localhost:11434/api/chat` returns a proper response
- Request through our proxy at `http://localhost:11435/api/chat` also returns a proper response

## Recommendations

1. **Account Issue Resolution**:
   - Create a new user account in LibreChat
   - Check with the administrator about the banned account status
   - Verify if there are any IP restrictions or security measures in place

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Ensure the browser is properly storing and sending the authentication token
   - Check browser localStorage/sessionStorage for token presence
   - Verify that the token is included in subsequent requests

3. **Browser Testing**:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try using a different browser
   - Use browser developer tools to monitor the authentication process

4. **API Configuration**:
   - Verify that the LibreChat API is properly configured to accept authentication
   - Check server logs for any authentication-related errors
   - Ensure CORS settings are properly configured

5. **Proxy Configuration**:
   - The proxy is working correctly, so no changes are needed here
   - Continue using the proxy for debugging to monitor request/response flow

## Next Steps

1. Create a new user account in LibreChat
2. Capture a new HAR file with the authentication process included
3. Analyze the token storage and usage in the browser
4. Test the API with the new account credentials
5. Update the configuration if necessary based on findings
