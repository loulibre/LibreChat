# Docker Essentials

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## Key Concepts
- Containers: Lightweight, standalone executable packages
- Images: Read-only templates used to create containers
- Dockerfile: Script of instructions to build a Docker image
- Docker Compose: Tool for defining multi-container applications
- Docker Hub: Registry service for Docker images

## Benefits
- Consistent environments across development and production
- Isolation of applications and dependencies
- Efficient resource utilization
- Faster deployment and scaling
- Simplified configuration

## Basic Commands
```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull ubuntu:latest

# Run a container
docker run -it --name my-container ubuntu:latest bash

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop my-container

# Remove a container
docker rm my-container
```

Docker has revolutionized how developers build, ship, and run applications by standardizing the deployment process.
