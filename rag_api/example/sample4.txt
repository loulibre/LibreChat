# Git Version Control System

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Key Concepts
- Repository: Storage location for a project
- Commit: Snapshot of changes to files
- Branch: Independent line of development
- Merge: Combining changes from different branches
- Remote: A repository hosted on a server (like GitHub)

## Common Operations
- Tracking changes
- Branching and merging
- Collaborating with others
- Reverting to previous states
- Comparing changes over time

## Basic Commands
```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add files to staging area
git add file.txt

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add initial files"

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Merge changes from another branch
git merge feature-branch

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main
```

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel and has become the most widely used version control system in software development.
