# SQL Database Fundamentals

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

## Key Concepts
- Tables: Collections of related data organized in rows and columns
- Queries: Commands to retrieve or manipulate data
- Primary Keys: Unique identifiers for records in a table
- Foreign Keys: Fields that link to primary keys in other tables
- Indexes: Data structures that improve query performance

## Common Operations
- Creating and modifying database structures (DDL)
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data (DML)
- Retrieving data with SELECT statements
- Joining tables to combine related data
- Aggregating data with functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG

## Basic SQL Examples
```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE,
    department_id INT
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-01-15', 101);

-- Query data
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 101;

-- Update data
UPDATE employees SET department_id = 102 WHERE employee_id = 1;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

SQL databases are widely used in business applications, web services, and data analysis due to their reliability and structured approach to data management.
